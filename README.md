One of my sales project focusinfg on coffee sales 
let's break though the steps and work flow code-side and dashboard side
code-side
First: the data was exported from kaggle in the form of two seprate CSV files
2- Concatination was done in order to add both tables in one dataframe
3- Day time and month were extracted for sales trend analysis
4- top coffee type sales were identified
5- The main dataframe were exported to Excel file Ready for Dashboard creation


Dashboard Creation
A dashboard was created with 2 pages Welcome page and a Dashboard Page. 
The Graphs were chosen so that it aids the Stakeholder in decision making.,
so bar plot was chosen for the top selling coffee type and
pie chart for payment method and one table for total sales of coffee types and 
finally 2 line plots for Trending sales on day time and month time.
